# ANN-with-Momentum
Artificial Neural Networks with Back Propagation and Momentum (Without using keras and tensorflow)

## Models
1. [Emergency Vehicle Classification - Ambulance](ANN_with_Momentum_Emergency_Vehicle_Classification.ipynb)
1. [Classify image as cat or not cat](ANN_with_Momentum.ipynb)

## Implementation Steps
1. Import necessary libraries
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - glob
    - cv2
    - random
    - os

1. Download and preprocess the dataset
    - Load Training and Test Datasets
    - Shuffle Training and Test Datasets
    - Resize and Normalize the images

1.  Initialize random weights and biases
    - Create dictionary to store weights and biases
    - Initialize weights and biases to zero for backpropagation

1. Fix all hyperparameters
    - Learning rate
    - Number of epochs
    - Number of layers
    - Number of units in each layer
    - Momentum (ùõÇ)

1. Until the termination condition is met, Do
    - For each training example, Do
      - **Forward Propagation:** Calculate the output of each unit and propagate through the layers.
      - **Backward Propagation:**	Calculate the errors (for output and hidden units). Calculate the change in weights & biases. Add the momentum and update the weights & biases.
